# Base16 Template for Faux Code

This is a [Base16 theme](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/)
[template](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16#template-repositories) for the
[Faux Code image generator](https://github.com/knutsynstad/faux-code), which
turns code into minimalist vector artwork.
